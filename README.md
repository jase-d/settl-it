# settl-it
This is a fun "social gambling" web app. Created the randomizer as a way to choose who would do the dishes one night instead of the game "rock, paper, scissors". Then wanted to take it a step further, want to help me take the next step?

For anybody looking to help things we are looking for:
--------------|styling|---------------------
Winning animation sequences (variety if possible)
Winning score should slide to center and slightly enlarge when round won
Audio clips for more user friendly experience
Animation in place for changing numbers (some type of number wind up)

--------------|advanced|--------------------
adding log in feature using local memory to keep track of wins / make a chores or 'to-do' list
Once logged in Names are pre-inputted
Numbers are chosen in the beginning and pre-inputted, however keep element's input to give option to change number

--------------|have fun|--------------------
If you have a cool idea in mind then do it; I'm always happy to see what directions different minds will take something
